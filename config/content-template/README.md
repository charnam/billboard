# Setting up billboard content

This README is a work-in-progress. Check this document later. Alternatively, you may view `content.js` as well as the source files *(ImageObject.js, GenericObject.js)* for sample usage.

## Setup

Copy this directory with the name `content`, and your billboard application should automatically load the content placed there.
